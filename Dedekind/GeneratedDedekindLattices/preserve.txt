March 3rd, 2015: GeneratedDedekindLattices will not be included in a git commit
unless a file is included. This is that file.

Note: We could have the application generate this folder as needed, but I believe
that because the folder's existence isn't tied to a run of the application
("dedekind world 5" would be a folder that is tied) the user might expect the folder to already exist.
