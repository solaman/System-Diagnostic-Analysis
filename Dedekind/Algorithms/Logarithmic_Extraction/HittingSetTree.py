    Taken from 'A Hybrid Diagnosis Approach Combining Black-Box
    and White-Box Reasoning'. This attempts to find all Minimal Subset of Constraints
    that will be inconsistent for the given Set Description.
    @param setDescription- A set of rules linking several items together. 
    Think of this as boolean equation in Conjunctive Normal Form.
    @param Constraints- a set of items we would like to include.
    Think of this as an assignment for the previous boolean equation.
