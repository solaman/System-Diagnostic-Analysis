    Taken from 'A Hybrid Diagnosis Approach Combining Black-Box

    @param setDescription- A set of rules linking several items together. 
    Think of this as boolean equation in Conjunctive Normal Form.
    @param Constraints- a set of items we would like to include.
    Think of this as an assignment for the previous boolean equation.
