    '''
    Finds the Minimal Inconsistent Subsets for the given constraints and set Description
    using a bottom up approach (where bottom is empty set). We check the powerset of constraints, and rule out possible
    MIS based on whether or not a given set is consistent.
    NOTE: There are probably far more optimal implementations of such an algorithm. However,
    for the sake of comparison, we are only interested in the number of times
    'isConsistent' is called and so we refrain from these optimizations.
    @param setDescription- A set of rules linking several items together. 
    Think of this as boolean equation in Conjunctive Normal Form.
    @param Constraints- a set of items we would like to include.
    Think of this as a value assignment for the previous boolean equation.
