    Finds the Minimum Hitting Sets/Minimum Inconsistent Subsets for the given constraints and set Description
    using a randomized approach. We check the powerset of constraints, and rule out possible
    MIS based on whether or not a given set is consistent.
    NOTE: There are probably far more optimal implementations of such a random algorithm. However,
    for the sake of comparison, we are only interested in the number of times
    'isConsistent' is called and so we refrain from these optimizations.
    @param setDescription- A set of rules linking several items together. 
    Think of this as boolean equation in Conjunctive Normal Form.
    @param Constraints- a set of items we would like to include.
    Think of this as a value assignment for the previous boolean equation.
